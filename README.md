# Communication_Strategy
Compare Websocket/REST/SSE via sample code

All libraries are present in requirements.txt.

* It is better to create a virtual env and then library installation.
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* invoke shell script to launch the web app. There are three different files - start_rest.sh [To launch poll based collaborative tool], start_ws.sh [To launch websocket based collaborative tool]
* on start , it mentions about the url address in terminal. Copy paste it in browser. Open 2 tabs/windows, and then see the effect.
